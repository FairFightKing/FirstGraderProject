                    This website is a school project to demonstrate our skills in web-design and web-development.
                    We had to choose our fictional character and make a presentation website about him/her.

                <h3>
                    Why this character ?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Bloodhound is a strong personality in the newly arrived Apex Legends game from Respawn
                    entertainment.
                   <br>
                    This character seemed a great choice to me since we don't know much about her, yet her actions and her force of will makes her stand out from the rest of the cast, 
                    <br> 
                    while she remains a mystery, playing as her in Apex Legends really makes you feel like the "Ultimate Predator". 
                   <br>
                    Her character design is complex and very specific,
                   <br> 
                    and as a special and unique person myself, I kind of feel connected to this character and I hope we can see it in the way I developped this website.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Have a nice journey here.
