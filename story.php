                <h4>Technological Tracker</h4>
                <p>Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever
                    seen – and that’s about all anyone knows. Their identity is a mystery wrapped in layers of
                    rumors: they are fabulously wealthy, a bloodthirsty murderer, a Goliath whisperer, a former
                    slave, half bat, and a dozen other things depending on who’s doing the whispering.</p>
                <p>All anyone truly knows is that Bloodhound is a force to be reckoned with in the Apex Games.
                    Bloodhound’s unparalleled tracking skills are a boon to any team they join, helping them root
                    out hidden opponents and tracking the enemy’s movements. Calling on Earth’s Old Norse Gods to
                    guide them, Bloodhound believes that destiny is a path that has already been laid out,
                    eventually carrying all to their death. But with that knowledge comes strength, because until
                    that day comes, Bloodhound knows they can’t be stopped.</p>
